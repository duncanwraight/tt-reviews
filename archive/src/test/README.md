# Architecture Enforcement Test Suite

This simplified test suite ensures that the key architectural patterns established in the comprehensive security overhaul are maintained and enforced across all future development.

## Test Categories

### Architecture Enforcement (`architecture-enforcement.test.ts`)

A single comprehensive test file that validates the most critical architectural patterns:

**Database Access Patterns:**

- Enforces `InternalApiService` usage in routes instead of direct Supabase client creation
- Restricts service role key usage to essential admin operations only
- Prevents direct database access bypassing the centralized architecture

**Authentication Patterns:**

- Ensures protected routes use enhanced authentication middleware
- Validates that sensitive operations require proper authorization
- Enforces consistent authentication patterns across all endpoints

**Component Architecture:**

- Minimizes `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage in favor of modular JavaScript
- Validates that `ClientScript.tsx` references external modules instead of inline code
- Ensures component architecture follows established patterns

**Error Handling:**

- Prevents sensitive data exposure in error messages
- Ensures error handling follows consistent patterns
- Validates that security-sensitive errors are properly handled

**Security Architecture:**

- Verifies that key security files exist and are properly structured
- Ensures architecture documentation is maintained and up-to-date
- Validates the overall security file structure

## Running Tests

### Run Architecture Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test

```bash
npm test architecture-enforcement.test.ts
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Philosophy

These tests focus on **architectural compliance** through static code analysis:

1. **Pattern Enforcement** - Ensure secure patterns are followed by analyzing source code
2. **Regression Prevention** - Prevent security vulnerabilities from being reintroduced
3. **Architecture Validation** - Verify centralized database access and authentication patterns
4. **File Structure Validation** - Confirm key security files exist and are properly organized
5. **Documentation Compliance** - Ensure architecture documentation is maintained

## Key Benefits

- **Fast execution** - Static analysis of source code without complex mocking
- **Reliable** - No external dependencies or network calls required
- **Comprehensive** - Analyzes entire codebase for pattern compliance
- **Simple** - Easy to understand and maintain
- **Effective** - Catches architectural violations before they reach production

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality, the architecture tests will automatically validate:

1. **Database Access Patterns** - Ensures `InternalApiService` usage
2. **Authentication Middleware** - Validates proper auth patterns
3. **Component Architecture** - Checks for modular JavaScript usage
4. **Security Patterns** - Prevents sensitive data exposure
5. **File Structure** - Maintains proper security architecture

## Key Architectural Requirements

The tests enforce these critical requirements from the security overhaul:

1. **No direct database access in routes** - All must use `InternalApiService`
2. **HTTP-only cookie authentication** - Prevents XSS attacks
3. **CSRF protection on forms** - Prevents cross-site request forgery
4. **Service role key restrictions** - Only for admin operations
5. **Type-safe authentication contexts** - Proper TypeScript usage
6. **Modular JavaScript architecture** - External files vs inline scripts
7. **Consistent error handling** - Safe error messages
8. **Proper RLS enforcement** - User contexts for database operations

These tests ensure the secure architecture established in the comprehensive security overhaul is maintained for all future development.
