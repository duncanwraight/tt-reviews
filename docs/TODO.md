## Bugs

- [x] Confirm modal on approving moderation item in admin area doesn't do anything

      ```

- [x] When submitting a player change for moderation, even a successful submission displays an error modal
- [x] No log out button anywhere for admins
- [ ] Submitting new Equipment gets a 200 response but doesn't do anything, the form just stays active on the page
- [ ] Approving a new Equipment submission throws an API error: {"error":"Authentication token required","timestamp":"2025-06-11T13:56:02.947Z"}

## Authentication / architecture concerns

- [ ] I would like to do a proper investigation of the application architecture
  - Does the Frontend directly interact with the database?
  - Does the Frontend authenticate with our API?
  - We should be using the API for DB interactions, and keeping the Frontend for essentially submitting API requests and rendering responses

## Post-live improvements

- [x] Update moderation interface to support player changes and player new equipment updates
- [x] Allow logged-in users to submit changes to players
- [x] Add "Playing style" and "Born" / "Plays for" (nations) to new player creation
  - Include in submission and frontend interfaces
  - Use flag icons for nations
  - Properly handle birth country vs. represents country distinction (e.g., Wang Yang: born China, represents Slovakia)
- [ ] Add "New Equipment" functionality for logged-in users to submit new equipment
- [ ] Add per-type sponge thicknesses for rubbers
  - E.g. inverted = <1.5mm then each mm up to 2.3, then max
  - Long pips = OX, 0.3mm then each mm up to 1.5
- [ ] Implement all SEO improvements on every application page
- [ ] Create a dynamic sitemap for use with Google Search etc
- [ ] Configure homepage to pull real data from database instead of mock
  - Also get search bar working
- [ ] Check SQL files in root directory, see if they can be removed
- [ ] Fix "Login to Review" button on Equipment detail page (may be an issue for Admins)
- [ ] Update Admin area to allow for configuration of almost everything - players, equipment and also categories for everything that requires a category, like sponge thicknesses and types of rubber
- [ ] On pages where a search bar features, hide the search bar from the top header
  - E.g. home page, search page
- [ ] Implement /equipment/category interface
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare storage for image uploads
  - See information in DECISIONS.md doc
- [ ] Include images as part of new player submission
- [ ] Improve the Discord webhook cards
  - More relevant information
  - Better looking
  - Better support for multiple results
  - Our URL cards don't look very good; no image etc. Can we improve this?

## Optimisations and Code Quality

- [x] ~~We seem to reuse the session checking code in a lot of components. Can we make this DRY?~~ **COMPLETED**: Implemented centralized authentication architecture with AuthWrapperService
- [x] **Replace browser alerts with modal dialogs**: Created reusable Modal component system with success/error/warning/confirmation modals
- [ ] Check the "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" functions in our page components - is this good practice?
- [ ] We seem to reuse `fetch()` a lot, do we not need a wrapper function for it to allow easy, DRY requests to our API layer?
- [ ] Are inline styles best practice with Hono JSX?
  - If not, let's remove them

## Security

- [ ] Check all code for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run a penetration test on our production application, using all of the frontend routes and API endpoints
