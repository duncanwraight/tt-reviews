- [x] When submitting a player change for moderation, even a successful submission displays an error modal
- [x] No log out button anywhere for admins
- [ ] Submitting new Equipment gets a 200 response but doesn't do anything, the form just stays active on the page
- [ ] Approving a new Equipment submission throws an API error: {"error":"Authentication token required","timestamp":"2025-06-11T13:56:02.947Z"}

## Security and application architecture overhaul

### Architecture Investigation Results

- [x] Completed comprehensive investigation of application architecture
- [x] Identified two conflicting data flow patterns:
  - **SSR Pattern**: Server-side pages access database directly via service keys (equipment pages `app.tsx:85-124`, admin dashboards `app.tsx:279-357`)
  - **API Pattern**: Client-side JavaScript calls `/api/*` endpoints with Bearer tokens (reviews, submissions, authentication)

### Critical Security Issues

- [ ] **Fix JWT token storage vulnerability**: Currently stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)
  - Migrate to HTTP-only cookies for auth tokens
  - Implement proper CSRF protection
  - Update `ClientScript.tsx:218-270` authentication functions
- [ ] **Audit and restrict service role key usage**: Currently used inconsistently
  - Admin pages bypass RLS: `app.tsx:282` uses service role directly
  - Equipment legacy endpoint: `equipment.controller.ts:73` creates server client
  - Review and minimize service role usage to essential operations only
- [ ] **Implement consistent Row Level Security (RLS) application**
  - Some operations bypass RLS via service role access
  - Ensure all user data access goes through authenticated clients

### Architecture Standardization

- [ ] **Choose primary authentication pattern** (Recommended: API-First)
  - **Option A - API-First**: All data access through `/api/*` endpoints with consistent Bearer token auth
  - **Option B - Enhanced SSR**: Server-side session handling with HTTP-only cookies
  - Remove hybrid patterns that create security inconsistencies
- [ ] **Centralize database access patterns**
  - Eliminate direct Supabase client creation in routes: `app.tsx:90`, `app.tsx:282`
  - All database operations through service layer with consistent authentication
  - Standardize client creation via `AuthWrapperService`
- [ ] **Refactor authentication middleware usage**
  - Current inconsistency: `auth.ts` vs `auth-enhanced.ts` middleware
  - Standardize on `EnhancedAuthVariables` pattern from `auth-enhanced.ts:6-10`
  - Remove legacy `Variables` type from `auth.ts:7-12`

### Frontend Architecture Cleanup

- [ ] **Reduce dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage** (identified in investigation)
  - `LoginPage.tsx:122-241`: 120+ lines of inline JavaScript
  - `ProfilePage.tsx:65-139`: Client-side data fetching in SSR component
  - `EquipmentSubmitPage.tsx:32-119`: Inline form handling scripts
  - Extract to separate client-side modules
- [ ] **Implement consistent error handling patterns**
  - Current mix: JSON responses, modal dialogs, redirects
  - Standardize error handling across `equipment-submissions.controller.ts:126`, form handlers, `ClientScript.tsx:264`
- [ ] **Consolidate client-side authentication logic**
  - `ClientScript.tsx` contains 380+ lines including complex auth state management
  - Extract authentication functions to dedicated auth module
  - Simplify progressive enhancement patterns

### Database Architecture Improvements

- [ ] **Audit all database access patterns**
  - Services creating clients: `equipment.service.ts:4`, `auth-wrapper.service.ts:77`
  - Direct client creation: `config/database.ts:4-23` with multiple patterns
  - Legacy patterns: `lib/supabase.ts:59-82` (appears unused)
- [ ] **Implement request rate limiting** for API endpoints
- [ ] **Add comprehensive logging** for security events and database access

### Authentication Flow Standardization

- [ ] **Update all authentication-dependent components**
  - Profile page API calls: `ProfilePage.tsx:71-85`
  - Equipment submission flow: `EquipmentSubmitPage.tsx:89`
  - Admin authentication checks: Header auth button logic
- [ ] **Implement proper session management**
  - Replace localStorage session storage
  - Add session refresh mechanisms
  - Implement proper logout across all clients

### Simplified Architecture-Focused Testing

- [ ] **Create authentication pattern compliance tests**
  - Test that all API endpoints use consistent auth middleware
  - Verify no direct database access bypasses RLS
  - Ensure service role usage is restricted to admin operations only
  - Validate JWT token handling follows security best practices
- [ ] **Implement database access pattern tests**
  - Test that all user data queries go through authenticated clients
  - Verify service layer consistency across all database operations
  - Ensure RLS policies are properly applied for all user operations
  - Test that admin operations use appropriate authorization checks
- [ ] **Add security vulnerability prevention tests**
  - Test for XSS vulnerabilities in user input handling
  - Verify CSRF protection is applied to state-changing operations
  - Test rate limiting on all public API endpoints
  - Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in error messages
- [ ] **Create architectural constraint tests**
  - Test that new API routes follow consistent pattern (controller â†’ service â†’ database)
  - Verify new components don't use dangerouslySetInnerHTML without justification
  - Ensure new authentication flows use centralized AuthWrapperService
  - Test that error handling follows standardized patterns
- [ ] **Implement integration tests for critical user flows**
  - Authentication: signup â†’ login â†’ access protected resource â†’ logout
  - Content submission: login â†’ submit review â†’ moderation workflow â†’ approval
  - Admin operations: admin login â†’ moderation actions â†’ audit trail verification
  - Discord integration: webhook â†’ moderation â†’ approval â†’ notification

## Post-live improvements

- [x] Update moderation interface to support player changes and player new equipment updates
- [x] Allow logged-in users to submit changes to players
- [x] Add "Playing style" and "Born" / "Plays for" (nations) to new player creation
  - Include in submission and frontend interfaces
  - Use flag icons for nations
  - Properly handle birth country vs. represents country distinction (e.g., Wang Yang: born China, represents Slovakia)
- [ ] Add "New Equipment" functionality for logged-in users to submit new equipment
- [ ] Add per-type sponge thicknesses for rubbers
  - E.g. inverted = <1.5mm then each mm up to 2.3, then max
  - Long pips = OX, 0.3mm then each mm up to 1.5
- [ ] Implement all SEO improvements on every application page
- [ ] Create a dynamic sitemap for use with Google Search etc
- [ ] Configure homepage to pull real data from database instead of mock
  - Also get search bar working
- [ ] Check SQL files in root directory, see if they can be removed
- [ ] Fix "Login to Review" button on Equipment detail page (may be an issue for Admins)
- [ ] Update Admin area to allow for configuration of almost everything - players, equipment and also categories for everything that requires a category, like sponge thicknesses and types of rubber
- [ ] On pages where a search bar features, hide the search bar from the top header
  - E.g. home page, search page
- [ ] Implement /equipment/category interface
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare storage for image uploads
  - See information in DECISIONS.md doc
- [ ] Include images as part of new player submission
- [ ] Improve the Discord webhook cards
  - More relevant information
  - Better looking
  - Better support for multiple results
  - Our URL cards don't look very good; no image etc. Can we improve this?

## Optimisations and Code Quality

- [x] ~~We seem to reuse the session checking code in a lot of components. Can we make this DRY?~~ **COMPLETED**: Implemented centralized authentication architecture with AuthWrapperService
- [x] **Replace browser alerts with modal dialogs**: Created reusable Modal component system with success/error/warning/confirmation modals
- [ ] Check the "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" functions in our page components - is this good practice?
- [ ] We seem to reuse `fetch()` a lot, do we not need a wrapper function for it to allow easy, DRY requests to our API layer?
- [ ] Are inline styles best practice with Hono JSX?
  - If not, let's remove them

## Security

- [ ] Check all code for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run a penetration test on our production application, using all of the frontend routes and API endpoints
