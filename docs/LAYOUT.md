## Implementation Priorities

2. **Homepage Layout** - Primary entry point and content discovery
3. **Search Components** - Core functionality across the platform
4. **Equipment Review Pages** - Primary content type
5. **Player Profile Pages** - Secondary content type
6. **Advanced Search/Finder** - Enhanced user experience

## Design System Integration

This layout implements the principles from STYLE-GUIDE.md:

- **Clean & Minimal**: Generous white space, subtle visual elements
- **Search-First**: Prominent search functionality always visible
- **Content-Focused**: Reviews and equipment data as primary focus
- **Globally Accessible**: Responsive design across devices

Layout uses the established color palette, typography hierarchy, and component patterns defined in the style guide.
