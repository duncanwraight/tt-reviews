# Video submission
- [ ] Add to full moderation cycle, like equipment, player and review submissions

# Search
Search box doesn't really work at the moment. Searches with more than 1 word don't work, searches with partial text don't work. I'd like to fix these, but also implement a smart bar:

- Search results should appear in a dropdown from the smart bar
- Results appear in categories, e.g. "Player", "Equipment", "Reviews"
- Results should start to appear in the drop-down box after about 0.5s
- If the user hits enter, a search results page should appear with the same categories

# Discord submissions
- [ ] Ensure all Discord notifications are consistent in formatting
- [ ] Ensure all information about a submission is included so moderators can make informed decisions
- [ ] Add "View on app" button for every submission to navigate to admin review portal

# Form modal
- [ ] Any time a modal response is used to confirm a successful submission, redirect to the user's profile page so they can see the submission

# Admin area
- [ ] Update the administrative navigation menu to have all submissions under a drop-down, e.g. "[Submissions] | Categories | Content"
