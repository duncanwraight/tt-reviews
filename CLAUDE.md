# Instructions for Claude

- To find general information about table tennis, and the terminology used by its competitive players across the globe, read `./docs/GLOSSARY.md`
- Application requirements can be found in all of the markdown files in `./docs/reqs`
- Tech stack and architecture decisions can be found in `./docs/DECISIONS.md`

## TODOs
- Every new change we work on should be stored in `./docs/TODO.md`
- You should read this file every time we start a new conversation

## Workflow
When you have completed a change, or a small batch of changes, always follow this process:
- Run formatter and linter commands
- Await my input to confirm the change has been tested
- Update the ./docs/TODO.md file to mark changes completed
- Stage all files in the repo with `git add .`
- Commit and push
